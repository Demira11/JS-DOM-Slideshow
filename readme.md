This project is a simple JavaScript-based image slideshow featuring adorable dog pictures. It utilizes basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a gallery that automatically transitions between dog images at regular intervals.

Features:
Responsive design: The slideshow is designed to adapt to various screen sizes using responsive web design principles.
Automatic transition: The images automatically transition to the next one every 2 seconds, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience.
Project Structure:
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
style.css: The stylesheet defining the visual presentation of the slideshow and other elements.
script.js: The JavaScript file handling the logic for the image slideshow.
HTML Structure:
The <head> section includes meta tags for character set, viewport settings, and compatibility.
Linked stylesheets (style.css) and scripts (script.js) are included.
The title of the webpage is set to "Gallery of Real Cool JS3 Images."
The <body> contains an <h1> heading with the class "title" and a <div> with the class "gallery-container."
CSS Styling:
The stylesheet (style.css) likely contains additional styles not provided in the code snippet, defining the appearance of the slideshow, gallery items, and any other elements.
JavaScript Logic:
The JavaScript code (script.js) selects the gallery container and its individual items.
It calculates the number of slides and the width of each slide.
The transitionSlide function shifts the gallery to the left, creating a sliding effect.
The setInterval function calls transitionSlide every 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds), creating an automatic slideshow.
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Enjoy the cute dog images as they automatically transition every 2 seconds.
